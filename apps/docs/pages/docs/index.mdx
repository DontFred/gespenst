# Gespenst

**Ge·spenst [/Gespénst/]**\
The scary UI Library for [Next](https://nextjs.org/) or any other React based framework.
\
**Disclaimer:** _Gespenst_ is highly inspired by
[Vercel Geist](https://vercel.com/geist/introduction). Some parts of the code
are directly taken from the Geist Design System.

## FAQ

### What is Gespenst?

_Gespenst_ is a open-source UI Library thats replicate the Vercel Geist Design
to make it available for anyone.\
The components are based on JollyUI and it's use primitives from Radix.

### How does Gespenst works?

_Gespenst_ is written in TypeScript and uses the latest React features. It's
using TSUP to bundle the code. The components are based on JollyUI, it's using
primitives from react-aria and styled with Tailwind. So it's customizable and
extendable. Because of the structured imports the client and server components
are separated. That means, components that are need to be flagged as "use
client" are and the server components are not.

### Why the name Gespenst?

**Gespenst** _Ge·spenst [/Gespénst/]_\
is the German synonym for "Geist". And Gespenst library is an open-source alternative
to the Geist Design System, just like the word "Gespenst" is an alternative to the
word "Geist".
